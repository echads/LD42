- Traveling through space at a specific velocity
-> Broken engines = slower velocity
-> Working engines = small speedup
-> Working and manned engines = faster speedup
-> A wall of death is following the ship, if its reaching the ship -> game over

- Ship
-> Systems
--> O2 generator
--> Life support systems
--> Power generator
--> Thrusters (multiple)
--> Med bay
-> Other
--> Fires can be started
---> Fires consume air
--> Doors between sections / rooms
---> Closing doors will cause oxygen to be contained in the rooms

- Crewman
-> Can repair broken systems
-> Can man systems (1 per system max) to increase their efficiency
-> Have health and can be damaged by events!
-> By manning systems they gain exp in running those systems and increase efficiency

- Random events
-> Easy
--> Random system failure
--> Oxygen leak (lowering ship oxygen by a fixed rate)

-> Medium
--> Solar flare (temporarily disables energy, so every system)
--> Meteor hit (AoE damage, and creates a fire in the hit room)

-> Hard
--> Gamma ray burst (causing random system failure of up to 3 system and every crewman looses 50% health)
--> Spacetime distortions (slows down the crew, but not the ship)
